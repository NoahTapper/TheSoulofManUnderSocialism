    <div class="mainsection">
        <p class="unblur">The chief advantage that would result from the establishment of <span class="disappear-text">Socialism</span> is, undoubtedly, the fact that <span class="disappear-text">Socialism</span> would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.  In fact, scarcely anyone at all escapes.</p>

        <p class="unblur">Now and then, in the course of the century, a great man of science, like Darwin; a great poet, like Keats; a fine critical spirit, like M. Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand under the shelter of the wall, as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world.  These, however, are exceptions.<span class="funky">  The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism are forced, indeed, so to spoil them.</span>  They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation.  It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this.<span class="funky">  The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than mans intelligence;</span> and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought.  Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. <span class="funky"> But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it.  Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.</span></p>
            
        <p class="unblur"><span class="funky">They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive;</span> or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.</p>
            
        <p class="unblur">But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. <span class="funky"> The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible.</span>  And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim.<span class="funky">  Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good;</span> and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life educated men who live in the East End coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like.  They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises.  They are perfectly right.  Charity creates a multitude of sins.</p>
            
        <p class="unblur">There is also this to be said.  <span class="funky">It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.</span>  It is both immoral and unfair.</p>

        <p class="unblur">Under <span class="disappear-text">Socialism</span> all this will, of course, be altered.  There will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags, and bringing up unhealthy, hunger-pinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings.  The security of society will not depend, as it does now, on the state of the weather.  If a frost comes we shall not have a hundred thousand men out of work, tramping about the streets in a state of disgusting misery, or whining to their neighbours for alms, or crowding round the doors of loathsome shelters to try and secure a hunch of bread and a nights unclean lodging. <span class="funky"> Each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society,</span> and if a frost comes no one will practically be anything the worse.</p>

        <p class="unblur">Upon the other hand, <span class="disappear-text">Socialism</span> itself will be of value simply because it will lead to Individualism.</p>

        <p class="unblur"> <span class="disappear-text">Socialism, Communism,</span> or whatever one chooses to call it,<span class="funky"> by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition,</span> will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community.  It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment.  But for the full development of Life to its highest mode of perfection, something more is needed.  What is needed is Individualism. <span class="funky"> If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.</span>  At present, in consequence of the existence of private property, a great many people are enabled to develop a certain very limited amount of Individualism.  They are either under no necessity to work for their living, or are enabled to choose the sphere of activity that is really congenial to them, and gives them pleasure.  These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of cultureâ€”in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation.  Upon the other hand, there are a great many people who, having no private property of their own, and being always on the brink of sheer starvation, are compelled to do the work of beasts of burden, to do work that is quite uncongenial to them, and to which they are forced by the peremptory, unreasonable, degrading Tyranny of want.  These are the poor, and amongst them there is no grace of manner, or charm of speech, or civilisation, or culture, or refinement in pleasures, or joy of life. <span class="funky"> From their collective force Humanity gains much in material prosperity.  But it is only the material result that it gains, and the man who is poor is in himself absolutely of no importance.  He is merely the infinitesimal atom of a force that, so far from regarding him, crushes him: indeed, prefers him crushed, as in that case he is far more obedient.</span></p>

        <p class="unblur">Of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type, and that the poor, if they have not culture and charm, have still many virtues.  Both these statements would be quite true.  The possession of private property is very often extremely demoralising, and that is, of course, one of the reasons why <span class="disappear-text">Socialism</span> wants to get rid of the institution.  In fact, property is really a nuisance. </p>

        <p>"The Soul of Man Under Socialism" is an essay by Oscar Wilde, first published in 1891. In this work, Wilde presents his vision of a society where socialism fosters individualism, allowing people to fully realize their potential without the constraints imposed by poverty and the pursuit of wealth.</p>

        <p>Wilde critiques the capitalist system for compelling individuals to engage in "unhealthy and exaggerated altruism," addressing social issues without tackling their root causes. He argues that charity, while well-intentioned, often prolongs the existence of systemic problems like poverty instead of eliminating them. He suggests that the proper aim should be to reconstruct society on a basis that makes poverty impossible.</p>

        <p>Central to Wilde's argument is the belief that socialism, by abolishing private property and competition, would create an environment where individuals are free from economic burdens and can pursue personal growth and artistic expression. He envisions a society where people are not reduced to the "level of a machine" but are liberated to explore their creativity and individuality.</p>

        <p>Wilde also warns against authoritarian forms of socialism, advocating instead for a system that promotes true individualism. He emphasizes that art is inherently individualistic and serves as a force that challenges conformity and societal norms. In his view, a socialist society that nurtures individualism would lead to the flourishing of art and, consequently, the enrichment of humanity.</p>

        <p>Overall, Wilde's essay offers a unique perspective on socialism, intertwining it with the importance of individual freedom and artistic expression. He proposes that by addressing the structural issues within society, individuals can achieve true self-realization and contribute more profoundly to the cultural and intellectual fabric of the community.</p>
